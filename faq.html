                    <summary>How do I choose an attorney?</summary>
                    <p>The hiring of a lawyer is a very important and personal decision and should not be made based
                        upon advertising alone. You should look for an attorney that is knowledgeable and experienced in
                        your area of need. Since it is also important to hire an attorney with whom you feel
                        comfortable, you should be offered an opportunity to personally speak with the actual attorney
                        whom you may wish to hire.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>How do I contact you?</summary>

                        We are conveniently located to all of Brevard County at 5575 South U.S. Highway 1, Rockledge, FL
                        32955, just 5 minutes north of the Pineda Causeway on U.S. Route 1. See Map.

                    <summary>What is Attorney-client priviledge?</summary>
                    <p>The Attorney – Client privilege is an evidentiary rule that protects both attorneys and their
                        clients from being compelled to disclose confidential communications between them made for the
                        purpose of furnishing or obtaining legal advice or assistance. The privilege is designed to
                        foster frank, open, and uninhibited discourse between attorney and client so that the client's
                        legal needs are competently addressed by a fully prepared attorney who is cognizant of all the
                        relevant information the client can provide. The attorney-client privilege may be raised during
                        any type of legal proceeding, civil, criminal, or administrative, and at any time during those
                        proceedings, pre-trial, during trial, or post-trial.



                        In the law of evidence, it is a client's privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent any
                        other person from disclosing, confidential communications between the client and his or her
                        attorney. Such privilege protects communications between attorney and client that are made for
                        the purpose of furnishing or obtaining professional legal advice or assistance. That privilege
                        that permits an attorney to refuse to testify as to communications from the client. It belongs
                        to the client, not the attorney, and hence only the client may waive it. In federal courts,
                        state law is applied with respect to such privilege.



                        It is important to note that this privilege will generally include a consultation with an
                        attorney even if you do not actually hire that attorney.

                    <summary>Can Crutchfield & Wilson handle cases outside of Brevard County?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. We frequently handle cases in Volusia, Seminole, Orange, Osceola and Indian River counties.
                        As members of the Florida Bar (and of the Georgia Bar in Mr. Crutchfield’s case), we are
                        privileged to represent clients in any county throughout the states of both Florida and Georgia.
                        However, please contact our office to discuss the specifics of your case if it is outside of
                        Brevard County so that one of our attorneys can help you evaluate the cost effectiveness of
                        hiring our firm versus exploring the option of hiring counsel local to areas outside of Brevard
                        County. If hiring counsel located outside of Brevard County appears to be your best option, we
                        are often able to assist you by recommending counsel who practice locally in that particular
                        County.

                    <summary>Does Crutchfield & Wilson handle appeals?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, if after analysis of a case it appears that it legally qualifies for an appeal and filing an
                        appeal would be timely. The appeal must be filed within certain time constraints from the date
                        of the Court’s written Order or Judgment which is the subject of the proposed appeal, usually
                        thirty (30) days. Therefore, it is important to contact an attorney quickly to protect your
                        rights.

                        In general, whether in criminal, civil or dependency (DCF) cases, filing an appeal is
                        appropriate when the lower Court failed to follow the law in its Ruling, and not simply because
                        the Court’s Ruling is unfavorable to you. If after review we agree to accept your appellate
                        case, you should be aware of the following: that our firm is familiar with the appellate
                        process; that we will diligently perform the legal research pertinent to the facts of your
                        particular case that is required; and that we will present your case to the appellate court in
                        such a manner so as to show that our position is proper based upon the facts of the case and the
                        law.

                        An appeal may not be required in some civil cases, and you may be able to obtain relief from a
                        Judgment, Decree or Order under a theory of mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, newly
                        discovered evidence, fraud, etc. under Rule 1.540 of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure by
                        filing an appropriate Motion to the Court. You must file such a Motion under this Rule within
                        one (1) year after the Judgment, Decree or Order is entered or taken. Clearly, your case would
                        need to be carefully evaluated in order to explore all of the legal avenues available to you in
                        obtaining your specific goals.

                        In Criminal Court, appeals are governed by Rule 9.140 of the Florida Rules of Appellate
                        Procedure, which (in part) states that a defendant may appeal:

                    <ul>
                        <li>(A) a final judgment adjudicating guilt</li>
                        <li>(B) a final order withholding adjudication after a finding of guilt</li>
                        <li>(C) an order granting probation or community control, or both, whether or not guilt has been
                            adjudicated</li>
                        <li>(D) orders entered after final judgment or finding of guilt, including orders revoking or
                            modifying probation or community control, or both, or orders denying relief under Florida
                            Rule
                            of Criminal Procedure 3.800(a), 3.850, or 3.853</li>
                        <li>(E) an unlawful or illegal sentence</li>
                        <li>(F) a sentence, if the appeal is required or permitted by general law</li>
                        <li>(G) as otherwise provided by general law.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- (A) a final judgment adjudicating guilt;

                    (B) a final order withholding adjudication after a finding of guilt;

                    (C) an order granting probation or community control, or both, whether or not guilt has been
                    adjudicated;

                    (D) orders entered after final judgment or finding of guilt, including orders revoking or
                    modifying probation or community control, or both, or orders denying relief under Florida Rule
                    of Criminal Procedure 3.800(a), 3.850, or 3.853;

                    (E) an unlawful or illegal sentence;

                    (F) a sentence, if the appeal is required or permitted by general law; or

                    (G) as otherwise provided by general law. -->

                    <summary>Can a lawyer guarantee a verdict or outcome?</summary>
                    <p>Absolutely not. As you are aware, there are very few definite outcomes in life - and that goes
                        for our legal system as well. No ethical attorney can guarantee a verdict or outcome in any
                        case. At Crutchfield & Wilson, what we can guarantee you is that we will give your case the
                        personal attention it deserves, the expertise it requires, and provide you with zealous legal
                        representation. Additionally, at the time of your initial free consultation, we will provide you
                        with a legal opinion on the outcome you can most likely expect and explain how we would proceed
                        in an effort to obtain the most favorable result possible in your case.</p>

                    <summary>How long will my case take to resolve?</summary>
                    <p>That depends. A simple traffic citation or truly uncontested divorce can usually be resolved in
                        less than a month. Conversely, a complicated divorce or bodily injury case can often take many
                        months to resolve. Most criminal matters fall somewhere in between. There are numerous factors
                        involved in estimating the length of time it will take to resolve a case, and this question can
                        only be accurately answered after learning the specifics of your situation.</p>

                    <summary>How much will my case cost?</summary>
                    <p>The cost for legal representation varies relative to the type and complexity of your case. Bodily
                        injury (also known as personal injury) cases are based upon a contingency fee agreement at
                        Crutchfield & Wilson, wherein your legal fees and costs are paid from any monetary recovery
                        obtained for you. As such, if there is no recovery, there is no fee. Criminal matters are
                        typically based upon a "flat fee" agreement, wherein you will be quoted a specific fee for
                        handling the case. The amount of the fee quoted is related to the severity of the crime of which
                        you are accused, your prior record and other factors. Family Law matters involving custody,
                        child support and/or alimony are evaluated as to the complexity of the case. You will then be
                        quoted a retainer fee based upon the attorney’s hourly rate and his or her good faith estimate
                        of the amount of time that will likely be involved in resolving the case. In some cases, it is
                        appropriate to request that the Court order your spouse or former spouse to reimburse you for
                        your legal fees and costs.

                        Should you choose to take advantage of our free consultation, we will gladly provide you with a
                        fee quote for your particular case.
